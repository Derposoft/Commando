## What is Commando?

Welcome to my first ever project! Created back in 2011 and uploaded to CodePlex in 2012, Commando is a C# XNA framework game I created that was automatically transferred over to GitHub when CodePlex shut down.

## How do I run this?

1. Download XNA 4.0 by following the "Install Instructions" at the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=23714 (this will require the installation of Visual Studio 2010)

2. Import this project into Visual Studio 2010 as an XNA project.

3. Build and run the project.


## TODO

- Add a precompiled installer so that you don't have to download VS2010 to play Commando
