## What is Commando?

Welcome to my first ever project! Created back in 2011 and uploaded to CodePlex in 2012, Commando is a C# XNA framework game I created that was automatically transferred over to GitHub when CodePlex shut down.

## What are .cs.txt files?

Back when I was an 11 year old, I didn't know how to use git, and ended up copy pasting the contents of the code files into files I created manually in CodePlex. That is why the C# code files, which were meant to be .cs files, were saved into the repository as .txt files. 

## Can I run this?

For historical and sentimental purposes, this (master) branch will remain the way it has been for the last 8 years, barring the addition of this README. However, the code and the assets for this game that I managed to dig up from my old computer are uploaded to the "full" branch. This includes a full Visual Studio 2010 solution which can be built and run using the C# XNA framework. The README in that branch will explain how to run the solution step-by-step, but a compiled installer will (soon) also be included in that branch if you want to play Commando immediately!
